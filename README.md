# love2d's bag of shaders

Whenever I find a cool shader somewhere I'll try to convert it to the love2d's shader structure and put here (if the original license permits, of course). This is mostly for personal use, but if someone is willing to contribute with pull requests I would gladly merge it.

## License and credits
Each shader file has the author name and/or a link to the place where the original code is. The license of each file will be the same of the original code.

## File names
Files are named with snake_case without uppercase letters or simbols other than underscores.

The file extensions are:
- `.frag` for fragment/pixel shaders
- `.vert` for vertex shaders
- `.glsl` if the file contains both pixel and vertex shaders
